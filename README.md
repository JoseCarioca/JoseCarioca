About Me

🎓 I'm currently studying a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Cadiz. 
Curiosity brought me in, and ignorance keep me humble enough to stay.

🌱 I'm still learning software development, data analytics, computability theory, mathematics... the list just keeps growing!

😄 Pronouns: He/him

💬 Mostly harmless... but pushes frequently.
